4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:

   NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here

### Features
- Search for tracks in real-time as you type
- View track details including artist and album art
- Play preview clips when available (30 seconds)

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify your credentials:
   - Make sure both CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET are correctly copied from Spotify
   - Check that there are no extra spaces in your .env.local file
   - Ensure the .env.local file is in the root directory

2. Common errors:
   - "Missing Spotify credentials": Check your .env.local file setup
   - "Failed to authenticate": Verify your credentials are correct
   - "API rate limit exceeded": Spotify has rate limits for free tier:
     * 30 requests per second
     * 3,600 requests per hour
     * Implement caching if needed for heavy usage

3. Development tips:
   - Check the browser console and server logs for detailed error messages
   - The search is debounced (300ms) to prevent API spam
   - Preview playback requires user interaction due to browser policies
   - Album art uses Spotify's CDN (i.scdn.co) which is configured in next.config.js
